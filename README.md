# Different-GBM-approaches
Implementation and comparison of GBM, AGBM and RGBM, developed as part of the Optimisation for Data Science course (MS Data Science, Universit√† degli Studi di Padova). 

We were asked to draw inspiration from the papers quoted in the bibliography (see: "Final paper" in the repository) and implement the following algorithms in Python language: 
1. Gradient Boosting Machine
2. Accelerated Gradient Boosting Machine
3. Randomized Gradient Boosting Machine 

Moreover, we trained and tested the algorithms on Lu et al.'s 2020 datasets and compared the results obtained.
